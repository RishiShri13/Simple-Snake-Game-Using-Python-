🐍 Simple Snake Game in Python

A classic Snake Game built using Python's built-in turtle module. Guide the snake using keyboard controls, eat food to grow, and avoid hitting walls or yourself!

🎮 Game Overview

Control a green snake using W, A, S, D keys to eat red food. Each time the snake eats, it grows longer and your score increases. If the snake hits a wall or its own body, the game resets and the score is updated.

🚀 Features

🐍 Snake movement and growth mechanics

🍎 Randomly placed food

💥 Collision detection (walls and self)

💯 Live score and high score display

⏱️ Adjustable game speed via delay variable

🎨 Built-in graphics using the turtle module (no extra installs)

🖥️ Requirements
